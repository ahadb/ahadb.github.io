Add value to yourself and to your future in whatever industry or walk of life you come from. If you're a web person I don't need to introduce you to the usual suspects: Ruby, Javascript, HTML5, CSS, PHP, Illustrator, Photoshop, Node, Angular, Wordpress, Drupal, et cetera.... We work with these systems on an everyday basis some profit highly from them (I hope we all profit from technology as well as give back to it).

Whatever industry you come from I opine there is alot of value in doing the opposite of what you know and what you do. You don't want to be doing the same thing everyone else is - that's the first rule of supply and demand.

If you only do cardio at the gym, do some weights and vice versa. 

If you constantly multitask, learn to single task for the day, week or month.

If you like .net learn jsp. 

If you like Apache learn something about NginX or Tomcat.

One of the ways to set yourself apart from others is to create value for yourself and learn how to extend that value by learning and doing new things constantly, as a matter of fact it should be a routine part of our lives.
I'll give myself as a little example here. For the past couple of weeks I've been using strictly IE for all my browsing. Heck I've been using IE for everything - all my development and design work. I've gotten used it's nuances, it's pros and cons, the way it performs as opposed to other browsers. Browser degradation? I'm becoming very aware of the little quirks of IE a and it really doesn't bother me anymore because I have to find plausible and passible solutions for Internet Explorer. Are they really graceful solutions is another debate all together (as grace is subjective).
My point is getting out of your comfort zone will help make you a better person, keep you ready for change and help you adapt to your situation very quickly. After all if you're not changing then you'll be left behind.
