You won't find the usuals in the list, like body-parser, nodemon, mocha, grunt, nodemailer, nodemon, jshint, connect, express. I thought it would be cool not to focus on mainstream stuff.

You can use small focused modules for reusability, flexibility and that are easier to reason about to then build more advanced things upon.
