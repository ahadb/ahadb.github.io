The term when used in the context of a bikeshed building (why should i care what the color of a bikeshed is?) is a phenomenon whereby people will give an opinion on an uncomplicated topic, whilst a complex topic receives little or no discussion at all.

We see this happening alot at the workplace, and I really feel that we shouldn't continuously use this metaphor as it really doesn't matter what the color of the bike shed should be - we can all build one over the course of a couple of days.

Empower others to build something and don't argue about every little feature just because you have the knowledge to do so. I suppose this is a trait about setting your mark when given the chance, a trait inherent in politicans whereby the amount of noise generated by change is usually inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.
