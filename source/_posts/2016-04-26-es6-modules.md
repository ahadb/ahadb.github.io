At the core of modularity developers need a module system — a way to spread their work across numerous files and directories with access to each other. Without support for modules natively in ECMAScript there has been a community created effort to implement work-arounds — CommonJS and AMD being the most prevelant as
they both have communities that rally around them, but are incompatible with each other. The good news is ES6, ( TC39 group ) has finalized a module syntax which developers can greatly benefit from using the best from both worlds.
* The goal of modules in `ES6` is to keep **both** `CommonJS` and `AMD` user happy with a single format and borrows the best from both worlds
 * `ES6` modules will have a compact syntax with a preference for a single exports ( such as CommonJS )
 * direct support for asynchronous and configurable module loading is supported
* There are two types of exports, `named` exports and `default` exports
 * **named exports** can be used to export multiple things using the keyword `export`
 * **default exports** used to export a default single value
* To import functions, objects and primitives that have been exported from an external module use the `import` statement
 * you may `import` an entire modules contents, a single member or multiple members in a module

A convenient way to specify `named` exports as below:
 
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// lib.js
// -------
export const quux = Math.sqrt( 2 ); // => exports a constant
export function multiply( x, y ) {
  return x * y;
} // => exports a function


export function addContact( id, callback ) {
  callback();
} // => exports a function

export function refreshContact() {
  alert( `Hello ES6 Modules` );
} // => exports a function
</code></pre>

And of course `import` them into another file:

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// main.js
// -------
import quux from 'lib';
import { multiply, addContact, refreshContact } from 'lib';

console.log( quux ); // => 1.4142135623730951
console.log( multiply(10, 10); // => 1000
console.log(addContact(1, refreshContact)); // => alerts `Hello ES6 Modules`
// app.js
// ------
// import the whole module
import * as lib from 'lib'

console.log( lib.quux ); // => 1.4142135623730951
console.log( lib.refreshContact() ); // => alerts `Hello ES6 Modules`
</code></pre>

Another technique in a module, we could use the following:

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const quatro = 10 * 10 * 10 * 10;
export { quatro }; 
</code></pre>

`default` exports is simple one module that you want to export as the default ( like CommonJS ) and it turns out you can use `default` exports and `named` exports both in your module. There is alot more on `modules` in `ES6` including `script` tags, using `promises` and `module loading` which is an API that allows you to programmatically work with modules and configure module loading.
