There is a fork of node.js called io.js - I feel they should merge as one, even though io.js is pushing for ES6 sytnax and better performance.

> SAN FRANCISCO, CA—(Marketwired - Feb 10, 2015)—Joyent, Inc., the container infrastructure software company and corporate steward of the Node.js open source project, today announced that it will move to establish a formal open governance model for Node.js with the creation of an independent foundation. Joyent will join forces with IBM, PayPal, Microsoft Corp, Fidelity and The Linux Foundation to establish the Node.js Foundation, which will be committed to the continued growth and evolution of Node.js, while maintaining a collaborative environment to benefit all users.

That most likely won't happen, and Joyent is formalizing or should I say consolidating their presence in the industry. Another fragmented framework, shouldn't there be just one governing body?
